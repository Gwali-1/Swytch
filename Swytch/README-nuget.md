Swytch is a web framework written in Csharp. It is lightweight, fast and gives an alternative and refreshing
way to author web services like REST APIs and web applications.It provides an expressive routing API, built-in templating
with RazorLight, support for asynchronous job processing using Actors, and seamless database integration with Dapper.

Make the switch and try it out!

- **Path Parameters** – Supports dynamic route parameters for handling variable paths.
- **Templating with RazorLight** – Supports Razor-based templating for server-side rendering of dynamic content.
- **Precompiled Templates** – Supports template pre compilation for improved performance.
- **Built-in Lightweight ORM** – Includes Dapper for efficient data access and interaction with databases.
