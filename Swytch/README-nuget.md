Swytch is a web framework written in C#. It is lightweight, fast and offers an alternative and refreshing
way to author web services like REST APIs, static sites and web applications.It provides an expressive routing API, built-in templating
with RazorLight, support for asynchronous job processing using Actors, and seamless database integration with Dapper.
